## Description
In this project I used sequelize to create 4 models to organize my data. The data refers to products, product tags, tags, and categories. Then I had to create relationships between the data. I then created routes using async/ await to get, post, put, and delete. This project came with both some seed data and a database. I used express to create the server. I created a .env file to hide my credentials in and added it to gitinore. I used npm run seed to populate the database with data. I then used Insomnia to verify that all of my routes work.
